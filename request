Dear dilshaadTD,

I am a Master's student and currently doing my final thesis. 
I'm using Gertler et al (2007) (External constraints on monetary policy and the financial accelerator) as a basis for my DSGE-model 
and just found your thesis and related codes via Google as I searched tips for coding.
However, as I opened the GGN2007.mod -file of yours for code-related tips, it seems that the code was related to the BGG-paper.
I was wondering, do you have the code for GGN-paper and if you do have, could you send that for me? It would help a lot with my thesis.

Ps. I was not able to find a way to send a message to you in other ways than this.

Yours sincerely,

Nico
